            <b>How will they bridge the gap?</b>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            By partnering with Clown Society to invest/ create real world businesses that'll bring in consistent cash flow back into the project, 
            without the need or pain of creating continuous projects here after. This also creates a source of income to fund $MNGO activities, 
            long term and maintain value for project holders.
