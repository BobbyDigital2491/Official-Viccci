            The total supply of Viccci is a limited and fixed supply of 2.75 million tokens, with no further tokens to be created or mined.
             A portion of the total supply will be distributed to users through a series of incentives and rewards programs. 
             These programs are designed to encourage users to participate in and contribute to the growth of the Social Exchange ecosystem.
              Viccci will be used as the primary means of exchange on the Social Exchange platform. It will be used to transact, tip, and 
              reward other users for their contributions to the platform. Viccci can also be used to access premium features and services 
              on the platform. In addition to its use as a means of exchange, Viccci will also serve as a store of value on the Social 
              Exchange platform. The value of Viccci will be determined by market demand and the growth of the Social Exchange ecosystem. 
              As the platform grows and becomes more widely adopted, the value of Viccci is expected to increase.The token distribution 
              includes a launch of 10% (275,000 tokens), a Community Development Fund of 25% (687,500 tokens), a Team
               and Advisors allocation of 15% (413,750 tokens), and a Liquidity Pool of 50% (1,375,000 tokens). The Viccci Protocol 
               incentivizes its users through a portion of the trading fees, community participation, and staking. The token can be used 
               for trading on the exchange, governance of the platform, and access to premium features and services. Any unused or unsold 
               tokens from the launch will be burned, reducing the overall supply and increasing scarcity.
