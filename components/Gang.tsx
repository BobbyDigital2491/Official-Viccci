    The art for Pandamania X (PMX) is completed. This is a 999 supply collection, with multi-art 
    styles (type): Samurai (777) and Mutant (222). Pandamania X (Samurai) main use will be to 
    consolidate some of our collections ( burn Hashmingos, Lady Mingos) ; and the 222 Pandamania X (Mutants) will be issued for free 'w/o burn' to 10+ Mutant holders (Elite Mutant)  will receive 1 for every 10 Mutants. Elite Pandas will receive 1 per Elite Panda held. There are other ways as well, but those are only guaranteed ways. Pandamania X next goal is to make it easier to distribute IRL business or Web 3 rewards. When IRL business becomes profitable, HBAR will be issued out through PMX.  A percentage will be placed into MNGO to help increase its value as well. A lot more details are to be released on this, the team is trying to iron out the final details.
