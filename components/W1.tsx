          The problem in the Web 2 space is that companies harvest vast amounts of data from users, 
          which they then monetize by selling it to advertisers and other third-party organizations. 
          This has led to a loss of privacy and control for users, as their personal information is 
          being used without their consent.
          
          Viccci Protocol is a decentralized social exchange built on Polygon Layer 2 technology that 
          leverages the principles of Web 3 to empower users to own and monetize their own data. 
          With Viccci Protocol, users have complete control over their information, and can choose to share
          it only with those who they trust. Additionally, through its unique governance model, users have
          a direct say in the development and direction of the platform, ensuring that their needs are prioritized.
